The Dojo

[Link to the project](thedojosite-355e3.web.app)

This app is for keeping track of your expenses.
Created:

- registration page
- login page
- user page

If the user is not authorized, only the registration and login pages are available to him.
If the user is authorized, he is redirected to the home page, where the cost sheet is located and the ability to create a new cost.

Connected to work with a database located in Firebase.

Implemented the ability to create several users who will have their own page with their own spending.
